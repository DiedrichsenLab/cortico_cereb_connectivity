# cortico_cereb_connectivity
This repository includes the code to train and test cortico-cerebellar-connectivity models, as described in King et al. (2023).
The original code underlying that paper is maintained in a different repository (https://github.com/maedbhk/cerebellum_connectivity).
This repository is a cleaned-up version of the original code, that also uses the FunctionalFusion framework (https://github.com/DiedrichsenLab/Functional_Fusion) to integrate knowledge from different datasets.

Initial results with the new, updated connectivity models are reported in Nettekoven et al. (2024), and are being used in Shahshahani et al. (2024).
